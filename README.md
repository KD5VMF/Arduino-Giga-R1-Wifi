Featured Projects
Breakout Game
A classic Breakout-style game built specifically for the Giga R1 WiFi and Giga Display. This project features:

# Multi-Core Processing: 
Utilizes both M7 cores for game rendering and logic, while the M4 core handles scoreboard updates to ensure smooth gameplay with minimal flickering.
Dynamic Difficulty: Levels become progressively harder, with intelligent paddle AI and ball speed adjustments that keep the game challenging.
Advanced Brick Mechanics: Bricks have different hit zones, adding a strategic element to gameplay. Players must carefully consider how to break them efficiently.
Tic-Tac-Toe AI
A Tic-Tac-Toe game with a smart AI opponent, optimized for the Giga Display. This project demonstrates:

# AI Learning: 
The AI improves its strategy as the game progresses, offering a challenging experience for the player.
Clean Graphics: The Tic-Tac-Toe grid and symbols are dynamically drawn on the Giga Display, maximizing its graphical capabilities.
Customizable Speed: Users can adjust the game speed to enjoy a fast-paced or slower-paced experience, depending on their preference.
Defender Game
A retro-inspired Defender-style game that pits the player against waves of enemies. This project includes:

# Multi-Core Parallelism: 
One core handles player and enemy actions, while another core manages rendering and enemy AI, ensuring smooth, responsive gameplay.
AI-Driven Enemies: Enemies adapt their strategies as the player progresses, becoming more intelligent and challenging at each level.
Smart Level Design: Levels become progressively harder, featuring dynamically generated challenges to keep the player engaged.
IoT Sensor Monitoring (Coming Soon)
This project will utilize the WiFi capabilities of the Giga R1 WiFi to create a real-time sensor monitoring system, featuring:

# Graphical Displays: 
Smooth updates and visually appealing graphs for real-time data, displayed directly on the Giga Display.
Multi-Core Optimization: Data processing will be offloaded to one core while another handles rendering.
User Interaction: Users can manipulate data streams and observe real-time changes for interactive data analysis.
